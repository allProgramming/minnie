---

The goal of this project is to lower the barrier-of-entry for aspiring hobby-roboticists. This is done by providing simple purchasing and assembly instructions, on a tight budget, as well as software to operate and customize the robot.

Minnie is a small, 2-wheeled driving robot (Currently based on the AlphaBot). Begin by following the ["Getting Started"](https://github.com/allProgramming/minnie/wiki/Getting-Started) instructions. Then, execute each of the following instructions in its own terinal tab...

```
roslaunch minnie_bringup full.launch
rosrun teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard.py
```

NOTE: Instructions and software/code are currently under heavy development, and can change at any time.
